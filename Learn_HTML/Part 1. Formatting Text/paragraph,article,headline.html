    <h1>Random texts from Attack on Titan</h1>
    <p>I don't know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that... No matter 
        what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it's right or 
        wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice.</p>
    <p>We are faced with two stark choices: to run and hide, or to stand tall and fight for our 
        freedom. I say we take the fight to the Titans and reclaim our world! Our fallen comrades will 
        not have died in vain! If we don't fight, if we don't take a stand right now, we may not get 
        another chance. We will not let fear control us. We will face the Titans head-on and we will 
        return to our homes!</p>
    <p>If you win, you <em>live</em>. If you lose, you <em>die</em>. If you don't <em>fight</em>, you can't <em>win</em>!</p>
